# Kitaabh - Online marketplace for books.


## Project Overview:
Kitaabh.com is an e-commerce website that allows users to order books online. The website includes a HTML, CSS and Javascript based front-end and a PHP and SQL based back-end. This is a full-stack web application that provides a seamless user experience.

The website includes all the major components of an e-commerce website, such as the ability to view and order products, manage user accounts, and store and manage user inventory data. In addition, the website has successfully implemented a hashing cryptographic process to add security for user ID and password authentication.
